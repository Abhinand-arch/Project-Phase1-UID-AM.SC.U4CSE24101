 <h2>Introduction</h2>
</div>
<div>
 <p>I have always been curious about how things work just on the surface, but deeper. Why do some ideas stick while others fade? What tiny shifts make the biggest difference over time
    This blog isn’t about radical breakthroughs or genius moments. It’s about the quiet, everyday kind of innovation: the small tweaks, the overlooked details, and the willingness to try something just 1% differently. Some call it optimization; I just call it thinking twice.
    Here, I share lessons from my own experiments—what worked, what didn’t, and why normal progress is often the most underrated kind of genius."

 <h2>The Moment when all changed</h2>
</div>
<div>
 <p>When I started CSE I had difficulty in Maths and other subjects. Through all those struggles confidence was developed. The confidence lead to tackling all problems one by one. 
   I have good friends who support me.Everything changed when I started precieving everything differently. When I came to understood the deeper meaning behind my all subjects in
   cse are used in real day life, a sprak was ignited. This spark is now burning like a raging fire enabling me to find innovation in things i do.
