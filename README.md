# Welcome to My Portfolio Website!  

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, share my thoughts, and tell you a bit about myself. Everything's built with simple HTML and CSS - no fancy frameworks needed!

## What's Inside

Here's how things are organized in this project:

- **Main file.html** - This is the homepage you'll land on first
- **About.html** - All about me, my background and skills
- **blog.html** - Where I write about my experiences and ideas
- **project.html** - Check out my coding projects here
- **Resources.html** - My favorite tools and learning materials

For styling, I've used:
- style.css (main styles)
- style3.css (projects page)
- style4.css (blog)
- style5.css (about page)
- style6.css (resources)

All the images and icons are in the project folder too - profile pictures, social media icons, and background images.

## How to Open It

Want to see it for yourself? Super easy:

1. **Download the files** from GitHub (just click the green "Code" button)
2. **Find Main file.html** in the downloaded folder
3. **Double-click it** - it'll open in your web browser!

If you're a developer and use VS Code:
1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Get the Live Server extension
3. Right-click Main file.html and pick "Open with Live Server"

## Quick Notes

- Everything should work right away when you open the main file
- If something looks odd, make sure all files stayed together when downloading
- No special software needed - just a web browser!
